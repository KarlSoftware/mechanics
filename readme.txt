This directory contains the blueprints of Multiplo's mechanical parts. It has the following subdirs:

m1:	Means "Multiplo 1", and contains the parts belonging to what we call "Multiplo version 1.0". These parts
	are 100% compatible with the newer ones, but belongs to the first generation of Multiplo, so most of them
	are not currently manufactured, but may be still very useful to be made by the users.

m2:	"Multiplo 2". These are the new designs we have made for the robots shown in
	Kickstarter. We plan to add more parts in the future to enrich the system as much
	as we can.

Both m1 and m2 directories contains the following subdirs:

2D:	These parts can be made with a laser cutter. This is the recommended method, but of course, most of 
	parts can also be manufactured with a 3D printer or a CNC router.

3D:	These parts need to be manufactured with a CNC machine or a 3D printer. Most of them can be replaced by
	2D parts, but using the 3D version is in general easier and achieves better results.
